## Pikkle Service Introduction
Pikkle is a blcokchain-based voting and attendance check service, participated by KBA(Korean Broadcasters Association), and developed and operated by the Blocko, Aergo’s technical partner. Users will enjoy a new user experience that anyone can check information on voting and admission in real time even for the layperson of blockchain technology.

## Problems with the Current System
Problems of the existing voting system :
There are many problems with collecting opinions based on SMS voting or public opinion polls.
1. Costly vote
   A. In general, voting requires a number of processes, such as setting the target of the voter, identification, voting, counting, and verification. Each voting process is not only complex, but also costly.

2. Untrustworthy vote
   A. The untransparent voting results problem has been raised for a long time. People think the vote is untrustworthy, from apartment residents' vote to the selection of the winners of broadcast programs and political vote.
   B. Especially in collecting opinions and voting on social media and big tech platforms, data can easily be contaminated. And voting results can be affected directly or indirectly depending on the interests of the platform provider. 

‘Pikkle’ is a service that solves the above problems with a blockchain.
## Introduction of the Service Main Functions 
Vote
Event participation

## Vote :
In cooperation with the KBA(Korean Broadcasters Association), Pikkle provides a user decision-making information collecting service based on an app, rather than a traditional SMS voting or spam-type cold call. We are trying to fix the problems in the process of collecting opinions arising from the process of gathering various public opinions including broadcasting programs. Pikkle will store key data(voter identity verification, validating the vote, voting results, etc) in blockchain and solve the problems by providing a voting service that every participant can trust. 

At the same time, despite widespread adoption in the mobile environment, many polls and preferences surveys are still conducted in the classic way, such as SMS or phone calls. Pikkle allows all voting actions to be performed only by redeeming the QR, so that voting actions can be expressed as a personal experience, such as participation in festivals, easily sharing, and expressing preferences on social media, not as an expression of duty or responsibility. It will be provided as an interesting service.
This has been attempted through various big tech platforms, but they were difficult to accept socially due to issues of public interest and platform dependence. Through blockchain, Pikkle will block any specific platforms or stakeholders from intervening in decision making, and will endeavor to facilitate interactive communication through voting in a wide range of content industries.

## Event Participation :
You can use Pikkle not only at various cultural and artistic events, festivals, and broadcast program hearings, but also at events in 'Metaverse'. Pikkle diversifies the experience of ‘participation’ by issuing blockchain-based NFT digital tickets.
Mobile tickets with blockchain NFT(Non-Fungible Token) technology enable offline proof of ownership, and will provide queue or enter into virtual space events such as digital concerts.
