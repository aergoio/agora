## Pikkle Service Introduction
Pikkle is a voting and attendance check service based on the AERGO blockchain platform. When developed,  KBA(Korean Broadcasters Association) will deploy in various broadcast networks and shows.  Pikkle will be developed and operated by the Blocko, AERGO’s technical partner. End users of Pikkle will enjoy the experience of participating on various entertainment shows involving voting for their favorite celebrity or give their opinions on various news topics. Voters will be able to vote and check the status in real time. 
## Problems with the Current System
The current voting system is based on mobile SMS or public opinion polls, which has inherent problems.
1.     Costly vote
   A.In general, voting requires a number of processes, such as setting the target of the voter, identification, voting, counting, and verification. Each voting process is not only complex, but also costly.

2.     Untrustworthy vote
   A.The untransparent voting result problems have been raised for a long time. People think the vote is untrustworthy, from apartment residents' vote to the selection of the winners of broadcast programs and political vote.
   
   B.Especially in collecting opinions and voting on social media and big tech platforms, data can easily be manipulated. And voting results can be affected directly or indirectly depending on the interests of the platform provider. 

‘Pikkle’ is a service that solves the above problems with blockchain technology.
## Introduction of the Service Main Functions 
Vote
Event participation

## Vote :
In cooperation with the KBA(Korean Broadcasters Association), Pikkle provides a user decision-making information collecting service based on an app, rather than a traditional SMS voting or spam-type cold call. Pikkle will store key data(voter identity verification, validating the vote, voting results, etc) in blockchain and solve the problems by providing a voting service that every participant can trust. 
At the same time, despite widespread adoption in the mobile environment, many polls and preferences surveys are still conducted in the classic way, such as SMS or phone calls. Pikkle allows all voting actions to be performed only by redeeming the QR code for specific event from an identified user.  Identity will be tied to the vote, so that one user will have one vote.  The user experience will be seamless and intuitive.  Voting can take place in many different venues, such as broadcast entertainment shows, news, festivals, public events, etc.  
Various voting platforms have been attempted by various big tech platforms, but they were difficult to accept socially due to issues of public interest and platform dependence. Through blockchain, Pikkle will block any specific platforms or stakeholders from intervening in decision making, and will endeavor to facilitate interactive communications through voting in a wide range of content industries.

## Event Participation :
You can use Pikkle not only at various cultural and artistic events, festivals, and broadcast program, but also at events in 'Metaverse'. Pikkle diversifies the experience of ‘participation’ by issuing blockchain-based NFT digital tickets.
Mobile tickets with blockchain NFT(Non-Fungible Token) technology enable offline proof of ownership, and will provide queue or enter into virtual space events such as digital concerts.
