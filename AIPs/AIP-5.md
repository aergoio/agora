# Emergency Voting
Agora voting: In the hacking incident at KuCoin, 66.8M Aergo tokens, held by Aergo holders in KuCoin, were stolen. Aergo Rapid Response Team worked to secure the tokens and its value for all Aergo holders. We have created blacklist enabled tokens and completed 1:1 swap for all Aergo holders. KuCoin has given guidance and requested Aergo tokens to be returned to the rightful owners within KuCoin. We feel this is the best solution to this incident and ask the community for agreement.

Please vote YES to comply with KuCoin's guidance or NO to not comply with KuCoin's guidance.
