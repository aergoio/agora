## Abstract 

As Aergo expands into an EVM-based Layer 2, the existing governance system—Aergo Agora—must evolve alongside it. This proposal outlines a plan to migrate Aergo’s community governance platform from Agora (on the Aergo mainnet) to Snapshot. Snapshot is a widely adopted, gasless voting platform that integrates seamlessly with EVM infrastructure. This change will enhance usability, and boost governance participation.

## Motivation

To support the growth of Aergo's EVM-based Layer 2 ecosystem, governance must be accessible, interoperable, and developer-friendly. Agora, while functional, presents limitations in scalability and user experience, especially for users outside the Aergo ecosystem. Snapshot addresses these limitations while offering key benefits including gasless voting, increased visibility and usability, cross-community governance synergy


## Key Objectives

- Enhance usability and boost governance participation.
- Maintain full transparency and increase the community engagement. 
- Ensure that all eligible Aergo token holders can participate in Snapshot-based voting.
- Align governance tooling with Aergo’s upcoming EVM-based Layer 2 infrastructure.



## Voting & Next Steps

This proposal is open for a community vote to determine whether Aergo should proceed with the migration from Agora to Snapshot. If approved, the Aergo team will initiate the technical integration, publish user guides for voting via Snapshot, and coordinate a smooth transition process. Snapshot-based voting will replace Agora for all future Aergo Improvement Proposals (AIPs).
