## Decentralized Trusted Timestamping

We would like to develop a technology element of Decentralized Trusted Timestamping that can overcome the limitations of existing Trusted Timestamping. The new system will be agreed upon by Trusted Consortium to ensure reliability without the need for a single third-party trust organization (TTP) based on joint collateral among internal members, and to help develop low costs and flexible related industries. Aergo will be responsible for providing technology of the blockchain, which is the core of the system, and develop products and related services that are needed to build reliability through consensus among participants.

### What to do

- DTT Backend : Service for Trusted Timestamping working by Smart Contracts
- DTT universal resolver : Universal Resolver for Multiple Blockchain Infrasturture
- DTT SDK : SDK for verifying and signing documents
