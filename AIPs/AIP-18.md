# What is AERGO Staking Reward?

Aergo takes a deflationary token model with lower fees unlike other projects giving out fees based on their inflationary model. Due to this reason, Aergo foundation decided to donate itâ€™s own allocation to reward our voters. In this way, we hope to incentivise more participants to participate in voting.

See the article below for more details,
