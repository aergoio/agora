# [CCCV.to](http://cccv.to/) to receive the Dapp incubation fund from AERGO 

[CCCV.to](http://cccv.to/) is a first-party Dapp being developed by Blocko’s Dapp Studio, Blocko XYZ since 2020. Blocko is the strategic technology partner of AERGO. This proposal is to fund [CCCV.to](http://cccv.to/) as AERGO’s Dapp for continuous development, partnership, and further expansion of the AERGO Ecosystem.

If you would like to develop a Dapp for the AERGO ecosystem and need sponsorship, please do not hesitate to contact us and apply for the AERGO Dapp Incubation program. The AERGO team is open to new ideas for the success of the AERGO ecosystem.

# CCCV.to

[CCCV.to](http://cccv.to/) is a decentralized identity verification platform using blockchain technology. In the blockchain, you verify yourself through a public key and signature. This structure provides privacy and anonymity. However, there is a problem with processing identity and business on independent blockchains in real life.

[CCCV.to](http://cccv.to) generate an individual’s identity on blockchain and this allows one to create an individual’s identity with diverse components on the blockchain. CCCV enable users to use personal credit/identity information in numerous Dapps and traditional service systems.

For example, most of the current defi loan systems are through the provision of collateral for blockchain tokens. However, a decentralized verification platform that will be established in the future will also enable credit-backed loans for personal income. As another example, you can selectively share your financial situation, investment experience, work and certified expertise in your existing system. This user experience will increase transactions on the AERGO blockchain in other traditional services and enables personal credit lending on the Aergo blockchain.

This is a step closer to the future of blockchain.
