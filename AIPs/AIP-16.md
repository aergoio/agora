#Why does AERGO need 10:1 merger?
1. Aergo's most trading take place on Upbit. However, the size of upbit's order book is in units of 1 won. Due to the heavy order book of 1 Won(Korean currency unit), the trading volume is at a very low level compared to the market cap. 10:1 merger can reduce the total number of coins from 500 million to 50 million while simultaneously increasing transaction volume and increasing the value of coins.
2. Although the mainnet has been in operation for a long time, most of aergo are in the erc-20, and there are very few aergo in the mainnet. In general, other coins generate additional income through staking by their owners and can reduce circulation and increase the value of the coin by being in the staking pool. However, Only a small number of accounts are benefiting from the annual interest rate of approximately 20%. Considering the approximate current staking amount, it is less than 10% of the total circulation volume. This is a disadvantage, but if you think about it the other way around, there will be no problem in merging because there is not a large proportion of Argeo in the mainnet.
3. How popular is aergo among coin users? Most of us are probably users of Google's App Store. If you are a user, open the Google App Store and check the download numbers. Number of downloads of aergo wallet: more than 100 (For comparison, booost, an m2e game using Aergo Chain: more than 5,000 times) In general, given that the number of downloads is not proportional to the number of actual users, it is estimated that less than 100 people actually use the aergo wallet. It is unfortunate that only a small number of people are receiving voting rewards. The solution is to change. By reducing the number of coins from the actual unnecessary number of 500 million, it will increase liquidity and increase the actual number of voters for the groundbreaking governance proposal, and the number of actual users using the wallet will increase exponentially.
