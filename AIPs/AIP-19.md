## Abstract 

Aergo Protocol is evolving to connect fragmented blockchain solutions into a seamless and scalable ecosystem. This proposal is being submitted for a community vote to decide whether Aergo should expand into the EVM-based Layer 2 (L2) and AI markets. By integrating a specialized L2 for AI, Aergo aims to enhance AI data management and enterprise adoption. This enables faster on-chain execution of AI logic while keeping Layer 1 dedicated to supporting existing Aergo Enterprise use cases, including potential data anchoring. By running AI-driven transactions on a dedicated Layer 2, Aergo ensures high efficiency, scalability, and low costs while preserving the security and reliability of the mainnet for enterprise applications.


## Motivation

As more businesses and individuals use AI in everyday applications, a blockchain that supports automation, security, and interoperability becomes essential. Aergo aims to manage the full lifecycle of AI-related data, ensuring secure processing, integrity, and cross-chain compatibility.

However, AI applications demand large-scale data processing, fast execution, and low transaction costs, making a dedicated EVM-based Layer 2 crucial. By introducing an AI-focused L2, Aergo can:

- Streamline secure AI data processing throughout its lifecycleâ€”collection, validation, storage, and monetization.

- Improve scalability and reduce fees for AI models and related data streams.

- Enable faster AI execution on Layer 2 while Layer 1 remains dedicated to Aergo Enterprise use cases like data anchoring.

- Create a multi-chain AI ecosystem, allowing AI models to interact across various blockchain networks.

By focusing on the full lifecycle of AI-related data streams, Aergo will ensure that AI models operate with high-quality, verifiable data, improving trust and usability in AI-driven applications.

This proposal seeks community approval to proceed with this strategic expansion, unlocking new possibilities for AI-powered blockchain applications.


## Key Objectives

- AI Data Management: Develop a blockchain-based AI data pipeline for secure collection, validation, and usage.

- Data Integrity: Ensure tamper-proof AI datasets.

- Asset Valuation: Build a transparent and reliable transaction framework for Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFT markets.


## Voting & Next Steps

This proposal is open for a community vote to determine whether Aergo Protocol should proceed with the proposed strategic direction. If approved, the next phase will include detailed development milestones, finalization of the governance framework, and potential integrations.
