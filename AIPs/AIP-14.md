# CCCV-NFT Service Introduction

CCCV is a social DID service based on the AERGO blockchain platform. Since last year, CCCV-NFT has been developed and operated by Blocko XYZ, Blocko’s D-App studio. NFT is an innovative technology that many creators, who aren’t familiar with crypto or blockchain, find it difficult to navigate. CCCV-NFT solved these problems with AERGO blockchain technology.


CCCV-NFT has revolutionized the difficult NFT minting process (from sign in to trade) from more than 20 steps to 4 steps and free of charge. Anyone can use CCCV-NFT easily, even if they aren’t familiar with terms like  ‘Ethereum’ or ‘meta mask’. CCCV-NFT is the NFT service of choice for many art museums, galleries, broadcasting companies, and entertainment companies in Korea.


# NFT marketing and exhibition agency

Many projects have declared that they will offer NFT services or marketplaces, but few killer services have yet to arrive. CCCV-NFT has performed outstandingly in the field of exhibition marketing for the NFTs.  This was the first NFT service on the  AERGO blockchain in 2021 and more importantly it was one of the first NFT marketplace in Korea, and its achievements changed the flow of NFT markets in Korea.


In 2022, more competitors are entering the NFT space and the market is changing rapidly.

Blocko XYZ is a marketing and exhibition agency that will expand the AERGO-based NFT ecosystem through XYZ's capabilities and its influencer network.  CCCV operates and manages the  NFT marketplace and the NFT badges, which recently became a hot topic when Vitalik Buterin mentioned it as SBT (ARC3 = ERC4973 compatibility spec of AERGO). We have been continuously working and preparing for a year and a half. We plan to proceed step by step to establish ourselves in the market.

Here are some highlights:

1. Sales and Marketing
- 2021, Blocko XYZ carries out various marketing campaigns and sales activities such as target market setting, viral marketing, press release, event promotion, and consumer feedback to create AERGO-based NFT.
- As you know, advertising campaigns driven by different entities are not only complex, but also expensive. Blocko XYZ plans to conduct sales and marketing this year by adding a more selective group that  will focus on spreading the NFT badge culture to the target group.

2. Exhibition
- Exhibitions are the most important events to gather NFT creators and help communicate with the public. It is easy to mint tens of thousands of NFTs per day, but it is difficult to make these NFTs stand out and take notice by the public. Blocko XYZ supports the creation of a flourishing NFT ecosystem by hosting exhibitions sponsored by AERGO in Korea.
- The upcoming exhibitions we can disclose are as follows.
    * 2022, June :  Gyeongnam Jinro Experience Expo

3. Influencer Marketing
- Blocko XYZ's CCCV service is already being used by many influencers. Blocko XYZ teaches AERGO and AERGO-based NFT to YouTube content creators and social influencers who do not have knowledge of blockchain technology and will support their creative activities with the advantages of AERGO technology.
- This year, CCCV takes the first step towards supporting original content creation and linking activities with retail and advertising fields on behalf of the AERGO eco-system.

# Vision of CCCV-NFT, 2022

* Expand the market area based on ARC2 and realize interoperability of heterogeneous blockchains through Merkle Bridge.
* We strive to replace the incomplete DID case, localized Accredited Certificate  (‘공인인증서’) with an ARC3-based NFT DID, and create successful application cases based on decentralized governance in a secure way.
* Expand CCCV-NFT to allow anyone who does not understand blockchain technology to experience the usefulness of NFT technology.
* Declare a vision to take another leap forward into a year that goes beyond last year's vision of 'Artgo' and becomes 'orgo' (Excelsior=always higher)
