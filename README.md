# What is an AIP?

AIP stands for Aergo Improvement Proposal. All AIPs must be consistent with the goals of Agora ([AIP-0](AIPs/AIP-0.md)). Currently there are three areas where AIP Authors can choose and suggest to make changes.

* **Argus** - For proposed changes to: Aergo tech development related matters
* **Dodona** - For proposed changes to: Aergo Ecosystem and marketing related matters
* **Agora** -For proposed changes to: Aergo Agora portal operation and policy related matters

# AIP Process and workflow 
The AIP process is a structured process for making changes to the Aergo Network. There are four parties involved in this process. 

* DAO Proposal Registration
  - Any community member or the Aergo Foundation can register proposals,
  - Proposals must include comprehensive rationales and logical frameworks, ensuring a clear understanding of the proposed ideas.
* Discussion Period
  - Aergo Agora introduces a discussion period lasting a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 30 days,
  - This extended timeframe allows for in-depth deliberations, enabling community members to actively engage in refining and enhancing proposed ideas.
* Democratic Voting Process
  - For a proposal to proceed to the voting stage, it must garner support from at least 20 participants (subject to change),
  - Upon conclusion of the voting period, the Aergo Foundation transparently announces the voting results.
* Swift Implementation Timeline
  - Aergo Agora is committed to efficiency, aiming to have all relevant DAO systems, guidelines, templates, and rules operational within a concise timeframe of approximately 2 weeks.
