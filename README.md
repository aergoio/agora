# What is an AIP?

AIP stands for Aergo Improvement Proposal. All AIPs must be consistent with the goals of Agora ([AIP-0](AIPs/AIP-0.md)). Currently there are three areas where AIP Authors can choose and suggest to make changes.

* **Argus** - For proposed changes to: Aergo tech development related matters
* **Dodona** - For proposed changes to: Aergo Ecosystem and marketing related matters
* **Agora** -For proposed changes to: Aergo Agora portal operation and policy related matters

# AIP Process and workflow 
The AIP process is a structured process for making changes to the Aergo Network. There are four parties involved in this process. 

* Author 
* Editor 
* Agora Steering Committee 
* Aergo Voters 

All AIP Authors who submit the proposal have to follow the template guidelines and follow each step of the workflow outlined in this document. The following is the process that a successful AIP moves along: 

* Stage I: Select AIP Track and submit a draft proposal in drafts folder
* Stage II: AIP editor review  
* Stage III: Agora Steering Committee review
* Stage IV: Aergo Community Vote ([Aergo Agora (Offical Voting)](https://voting.aergo.io))

# Status Terms

* **Draft** - an AIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
* **Accepted** - If such a decision is made from Aergo council, the AIP will move to Approved.
* **Approved** - An Aergo Foundation have decided to implement and release.
* **Rejected** - Voting result is rejected.

# Aergo Voting day 
There will be four Aergo voting days annually. The Aergo Voting will take place once a quarter on designated days as follows, starting at 8:00 UTC, lasting for 48 hours:

* Q1 - 1st March starting at 8:00 UTC closing at 3rd March at 8:00 UTC
* Q2 - 1st June starting at 8:00 UTC closing at 3rd June at 8:00 UTC
* Q3 - 1st September starting at 8:00 UTC closing at 3rd September at 8:00 UTC
* Q4 - 1st December starting at 8:00 UTC closing at 3rd December at 8:00 UTC

AIP Authors should submit proposals by the 1st of the preceding month of the Aergo voting day (e.g. 1st Feb for submission for March voting day). The proposals that have successfully passed Stage III will be announced on the 25th of the preceding month of the Aergo Voting day (e.g. 25th Feb for voting for March voting day). These proposals will appear on the Agora portal for the Aergo Community vote on the Voting day. 

# Emergency voting 

The committee can call an emergency Aergo network vote or re-schedule a vote at any time by a unanimous approval vote of the steering committee. In case of emergency, immediately following approval by the board, the Committee will make a best effort notification to AERGO holders of the start date and time of the vote using these communication channels:

* The [AIPs](AIPs/) folder
* The official [#announcements](https://t.me/aergoofficial) channel in telegram 
* The official Aergo [@aergo_io](https://twitter.com/aergo_io) twitter account

# Vote counting 
The minimum support required for approval is >50% of all votes cast, an “absolute majority”. 

If the result is a split vote, the Agora Steering Committee will reschedule a vote. The new start date of the vote must be no more than 30 days later than the previous start date of the vote (a maximum of two voting rounds, regardless of split vote(s)).
